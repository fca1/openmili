# openmili
Open implementation of the Mi-Light 2.4GHz LED light control protocol

Slightly modified version of the Henryk Pl√∂tz version.
This one allows the automatic switching between keywords, channels and length of the messages so that you can read any milight remote and get the codes. 
This version includes the new RGB + CCT remotes alswell as the older CCT, RGBW and RGB remotes.

Below you can see the ouput of the program showing several different remotes with different protocols being received on the fly at the same time without changing any code.
